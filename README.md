# README

This package enables the simulation of panel data with independent effects in the cross-section and cases (over time). Independently generating these two dimensions of variance in a panel data set permits much more robust consideration of how one-way and two-way fixed effects and random effects models handle TSCS/panel data. The package also enables the simulation of autocorrelation in either the over-time dimension and the correlation (spatial) dimension. See the package vignette for more information and usage.
