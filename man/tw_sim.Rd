\title{Run Monte Carlo Simulations on Panel Data}
\usage{
tw_sim(
  iter = 1000,
  cores = 1,
  parallel = FALSE,
  arg = "cross.eff.mean",
  at1 = seq(-1, 1, by = 0.1),
  at2 = NULL,
  models = c("randomfx", "wfe", "gsynth"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{iter}{The number of Monte Carlo simulations to run. This effects the precision of the estimates.}

\item{cores}{The number of cores to run the simulations in parallel.}

\item{parallel}{whether to use parallel processing if \code{cores>1}.}

\item{arg}{A character value of which model parameter from \code{link{tw_data}} to vary across simulations.}

\item{models}{A list of additional models besides fixed effects models to fit to the data.}

\item{...}{All additional parameters to pass on to \code{link{tw_data}}, such as 
average effects in case or cross-sectional dimensions of the data.}

\item{at}{A numeric sequence giving the range of values of the \code{arg} parameter to vary across.}
}
\value{
This function returns a \code{data.frame} with the two-way fixed effects coefficient, 
both case (over-time) and cross-sectional 1-way fixed effects estimates, pooled OLS model
estimates, and a random-effects estimate. Each row of the \code{data.frame} represents
one sample of panel data drawn from \code{link{tw_data}}. This data can then be plotted with the 
\code{\link{tw_plot}} function to see results of the simulation.
}
\description{
Use this function to run your own Monte Carlo experiments on panel data.
}
\details{
The \code{tw_sim} function acts as a frontend to the \code{link{tw_data}} function that 
generates panel data given a set of parameters. The arguments are fairly self-explanatory, and 
any underlying panel data parameters are passed on to \code{link{tw_data}}, so review that help
site for more information. The simulation works by passing a character value of one of the 
parameters from the \code{link{tw_data}} function to the \code{arg} option, such as \code{cross.eff.mean}
for varying cross-sectional effects. The \code{at} option must take a numeric vector giving the range of
values to iterate over, such as \code{seq(-1,1,by=.1)} to test values of \code{cross.eff.mean} from
-1 to 1 in increments of .1.
